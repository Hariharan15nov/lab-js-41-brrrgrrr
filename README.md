## LAB | BRRRGRRR

Mama Jenny is the best cook you've ever met. She makes the most amazing burgers in her tiny diner across the street. Mama is extremely popular and has recently had the idea to take her business online. Unfortunately, she isn't the best at web development. I've heard you are though. Help Mama create a website that'll attract more audience and help her make a living through it. Go to the `src/app.js` file and complete all the unfinished code to satiate her sweet tooth.

## Trial 1: What do we have here?

For your first task, you've got to enable the different layers of the burger on the screen. Create a `render()` for each ingredient and make sure that it displays the selected player.

## Trial 2: Give me an extra cheese!

Setup `EventListeners`, so that we can add or remove different ingredients by clicking on the respective ingredient buttons. That's the whole point of it.

## Challenge 1: Do I need more cheese?

Make the ingredient buttons popup or not based on their current active state. This would help customers identify what they've selected and what not.

## Challenge 2: Note my order!

Show the customer only the ingredients that they've selected on the chalk board.

## Judgement 1: Bill the BRRRGRR!!

The customer has had a good time customizing his brrgrr. Time for him to pay up. Use ingredient prices to calculate how much a burger costs and display it to the customer.
